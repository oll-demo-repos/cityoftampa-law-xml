          <text><em>Synthetic chemical</em> or <em>synthetic chemical compound:</em> Refers to a chemical or chemical compound whose molecular make up is similar to those substances listed as controlled substances in F.S. Ch. 893, and whose intended primary use when introduced into the human body is to mimic the effects of a controlled substance.</text>
          <text><em>Synthetic drugs:</em> Means both "synthetic cannabinoids" and "bath salts" as defined in this ordinance.</text>
          <text><em>Synthetic cannabinoids:</em> Means any herbal or plant material which has been soaked, sprayed, or otherwise enhanced with a synthetic chemical or synthetic chemical compound that enables the herbal or plant material, or the smoke emitted from its burning, to mimic or simulate the effects of a controlled substance when inhaled, ingested, or otherwise introduced into the human body. Any herbal or plant material described above shall be considered a synthetic cannabinoid regardless of the labeling posted on the packaging for the material and regardless of whether the labeling states that its contents are "not for human consumption", "not for smoking", or contains some other similar statement. The fact that a herbal or plant material, packaged and advertised as a food additive, plant food, insect repellant, potpourri, incense, etc., has been soaked, sprayed, or otherwise enhanced with a synthetic chemical or synthetic chemical compound which has no legitimate relation to the advertised use of the product may be considered in determining whether the product is considered a synthetic cannabinoid. This term specifically does not include any herbal or plant material containing synthetic chemicals or chemical compounds which: (1) require a prescription; (2) are approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration; and (3) are dispensed in accordance with Florida and federal law.</text>
          <text><em>Bath salts:</em> Means any granular, powdered, stick, or block material which has been treated, or otherwise enhanced with a synthetic chemical or synthetic chemical compound that enables the material, or the smoke emitted from its burning, to mimic or simulate the effects of a narcotic or other controlled substance when inhaled, ingested, or otherwise introduced into the human body. Any material described above shall be considered a synthetic drug regardless of the labeling posted on the packaging for the material and regardless of whether the labeling states that its contents are "not for human consumption", "not for smoking", or contains some other similar statement. The fact that a material, packaged and advertised as a cleaning agent, food additive, therapeutic bath crystals, plant food, insect repellant potpourri, incense, etc., has been soaked, sprayed, or otherwise enhanced with a synthetic chemical or synthetic chemical compound which has no legitimate relation to the advertised use of the product may be considered in determining whether the product is considered a synthetic drug. This term specifically does not include any material containing synthetic chemicals or chemical compounds which: (1) require a prescription; (2) are approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration; and (3) are dispensed in accordance with Florida and federal law.</text>
          <text><em>Controlled substance:</em> Means any substance defined or listed in F.S. § 893.03, schedule I, II, III, or IV, as amended including any isomers, esters, ethers, salts, and salts of isomers, esters, and ethers of such substances.</text>

          <text><em>Determination that product is a synthetic drug.</em> The following factors, taken in the totality of the circumstances, may be considered in determining whether a product, substance, or other material should be classified as a synthetic drug.

      <heading>Legislative intent.</heading>
      <text>The intent of the City of Tampa in adopting this article is to broadly prohibit the possession and/or use of simulated gambling devices, including any related activity or behavior which can be reasonably construed to be the use of simulated gambling devices. Further, the City of Tampa, in prohibiting simulated gambling devices, in no way intends to approve the use of actual slot machines, other forms of casino gambling, or other types of gambling devices. In addition, this prohibition is aimed directly at devices that simulate gambling activity, regardless of whether the devices or the simulations in and of themselves constitute gambling. The interests of the citizens of the City of Tampa will be better served if the operation and use of simulated gambling devices is prohibited and existing devises are adequately regulated. This would ensure the limitation of the expanded operation and use of simulated gambling devices within the City of Tampa.</text>

      <text><em>Conversion therapy</em> or <em>reparative therapy</em> means, interchangeably, any counseling, practice or treatment performed with the goal of changing an individual's sexual orientation or gender identity, including, but not limited to, efforts to change behaviors, gender identity, or gender expression, or to eliminate or reduce sexual or romantic attractions or feelings toward individuals of the same gender or sex. Conversion therapy does not include counseling that provides support and assistance to a person undergoing gender transition or counseling that provides acceptance, support, and understanding of a person or facilitates a person's coping, social support, and development, including sexual orientation-neutral interventions to prevent or address unlawful conduct or unsafe sexual practices, as long as such counseling does not seek to change sexual orientation or gender identity.</text>
      <text><em>Minor</em> means any person less than eighteen (18) years of age.</text>
      <text><em>Provider</em> means any person who is licensed by the State of Florida to provide professional counseling, or who performs counseling as part of his or her professional training under F.S. chs. 456, 458, 459, 490 or 491, as such chapters may be amended, including but not limited to, medical practitioners, osteopathic practitioners, psychologists, psychotherapists, social workers, marriage and family therapists, and licensed counselors. A provider does not include members of the clergy who are acting in their roles as clergy or pastoral counselors and providing religious counseling to congregants, as long as they do not hold themselves out as operating pursuant to any of the aforementioned Florida Statutes licenses.</text>
