Further, no person designated as a health care surrogate shall be denied or otherwise defeated in serving as a health care surrogate based solely upon his or her status as the domestic partner of the partner on whose behalf health care decisions are to be made. Any statutory form, including but not limited to, a living will or health care surrogate designation in the form prescribed by F.S. ch. 765, that is properly executed after the date of registration which contains conflicting designations shall control over the designations by virtue of the registration.</text>
